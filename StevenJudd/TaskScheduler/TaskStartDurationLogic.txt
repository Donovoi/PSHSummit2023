Get Trigger Type
If the Trigger Type is One Time
  AND Trigger Repetition Duration is set
    Calculate if the StartBoundary + Repetition Duration < Current Date
      If True, Task cannot run
      If False,
        Calculate next run start time
        If Trigger Execution Time Limit
          Calculate end time from start time
        ElseIf Settings Execution Time Limit <> PT0S
          Calculate end time from start time
        Else
          No end time set
If the Trigger Type is Daily
  If the Trigger Repetition Duration < 1 Day
    Calculate time Task must stop
    Calculate next run start time
      If run time < stop time
        Return run start time
      If Repetition Interval
        Add Interval to start time
        If start time < stop time
          Return run start time
        LOOP until start time >= stop time
    FOREACH start time
      If Trigger Execution Time Limit
        Calculate end time from start time
      ElseIf Settings Execution Time Limit <> PT0S
        Calculate end time from start time
      Else
        No end time set
      LOOP FOREACH
  ElseIf
    Stop time = Trigger Start Boundary + 24H
    Start time = Trigger Start Boundary
    If Repetition Interval
      Add Interval to start time
      If start time < stop time
        Return run start time
      LOOP until start time >= stop time
    FOREACH start time
      If Trigger Execution Time Limit
        Calculate end time from start time
      ElseIf Settings Execution Time Limit <> PT0S
        Calculate end time from start time
      Else
        No end time set
      LOOP FOREACH
